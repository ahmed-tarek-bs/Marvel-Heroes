# Marvel-Heroes
A demo application that demonstrates modern android architecture with MVVM and clean architecture.

## üèõ Architecture
### Clean Architecture
The code follows Google's recommended architecture, which is a lite version of clean architecture.

1. **UI Layer** <br/>
The role of the UI layer (or presentation layer) is to display the application data on the screen. Whenever the data changes, either due to user interaction (such as pressing a button) or external input (such as a network response), the UI should update to reflect the changes.

    - `UI elements` that render the data on the screen. 
    -  `State holders` (ViewModel) that hold data, expose it to the UI, and handle logic.

2. **Data Layer** <br/>
    - The data layer of an app contains the `business logic`. The business logic is what gives value to your app ‚Äî it's made of rules that determine how your app creates, stores, and changes data.
    - The data layer is made of `repositories` that each can contain zero to many `data sources`.

3. **Domain Layer** <br/>
    - The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is `reused` by multiple ViewModels.
    - It contains useCases, business models, and repositories interfaces.

  - The domain layer includes interfaces for repositories, so UI layer is restricted to accessing only the domain layer.

  - The data models that you want to expose from the repositories might be a subset of the information that you get from the different data sources.
  - It's a good practice to separate model classes and have your repositories expose only the data that the other layers of the hierarchy require.
  - Separating model classes is beneficial in the following ways:
    - It saves app memory by reducing the data to only what's needed.
    - It adapts external data types to data types used by your app‚Äîfor example, your app might use a different data type to represent dates.
    - It provides better separation of concerns‚Äîfor example, members of a large team could work individually on the network and UI layers of a feature if the model class is defined beforehand.
